        <h1 id="Boston-Red-Sox-Eye-Legal-Vigorish-in-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Boston-Red-Sox-Eye-Legal-Vigorish-in-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Boston Red Sox Eye Legal Vigorish in Sports Betting"></a>Boston Red Sox Eye Legal Vigorish in Sports Betting</h1><p>Boston Red Sox ownership group Fenway Sports Management is believed to be eyeing a piece of the sports betting market, according to a report from Reuters.</p>
<p>FSM has been in discussions with Las Vegas casino moguls and sports book operators as the company looks to expand its portfolio outside of traditional sports team ownership.</p>
<p>“It’s not out of the question that there are people in those organizations who want to own a sportsbook,” said FSM president Sam Kennedy. “But we have not made any decisions.”</p>
<p>The move makes sense for the Red Sox, who would be able to leverage their popular brand and gain a piece of the estimated $150 billion global gambling market.</p>
<p>Legalized sports betting has taken off in recent years, with several U.S. states now offering betting services. Nevada has been at the forefront of legalized gambling for decades, but New Jersey and Delaware have also seen success in marketing their services.</p>
<p>The NFL and other major professional leagues have been slow to come around on legalized sports betting, but they may be warming up to the idea as they see the potential for additional revenue streams. The NBA was one of the first leagues to partner with a regulated betting operator, and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell recently said that he is “open minded” to legalized sports betting.</p>
<p>Boston would be an attractive market for legalized sports betting, as it is both a large city and home to one of the most popular teams in North America. The Red Sox would join several other New England-based companies who have already entered the sports betting market, including DraftKings and Twin River Casino Hotel.</p>
<h1 id="Boston-Red-Sox-Flex-Muscles-in-Push-for-Legal-Vigorish-in-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Boston-Red-Sox-Flex-Muscles-in-Push-for-Legal-Vigorish-in-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Boston Red Sox Flex Muscles in Push for Legal Vigorish in Sports Betting"></a>Boston Red Sox Flex Muscles in Push for Legal Vigorish in Sports Betting</h1><p>Boston Red Sox officials are primed and ready to flex their muscles in order to ensure they secure a healthy cut of the sports betting action when legalized in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Red Sox President and CEO Sam Kennedy made it clear that his team wants a “significant” piece of the sports betting pie, which is expected to be up for grabs when legislation is introduced in the state later this year.</p>
<p>Kennedy also said that he believes sports betting will be legalized in Massachusetts within the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Red Sox officials believe their team – one of the most popular in the country – can help attract bettors to licensed sportsbooks, generating significant revenue for the club in the process.</p>
<p>The push by Boston is part of a larger trend among professional sports franchises as they seek to get a piece of the estimated $150 billion that will be wagered on sports each year once legalization takes hold across the country.</p>
<p>That number is expected to grow even more after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year paved the way for states to legalize gambling on individual sporting events.</p>
<p>Since then, Delaware, New Jersey and West Virginia have all moved forward with legislation that allows sports betting, with more states likely to follow suit in the months and years ahead.</p>
<p>Boston isn’t alone in its quest for a slice of the sports betting pie. Other teams including the Philadelphia 76ers, Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins have also made it clear they want to be involved when gambling is legalized in their respective states.</p>
<h1 id="Boston-Red-Sox-Ready-to-Battle-for-Legal-Vigorish-in-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Boston-Red-Sox-Ready-to-Battle-for-Legal-Vigorish-in-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Boston Red Sox Ready to Battle for Legal Vigorish in Sports Betting"></a>Boston Red Sox Ready to Battle for Legal Vigorish in Sports Betting</h1><p>Boston Red Sox executives met last week to plot their strategy for legal sports betting. The state of Massachusetts is one of several states that are debating the legalization of sports betting in the wake of the Supreme Court’s overturning of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA).</p>
<p>The Red Sox want a piece of the action, and they’re not alone. All four major US pro sports leagues – MLB, NFL, NBA and NHL – are jockeying for a position in what is expected to be a multi-billion dollar industry. The leagues hope to get a cut of the action by partnering with casinos and gaming companies.</p>
<p>There are many unanswered questions at this point, such as what types of bets will be allowed and how much the leagues will get in return. But one thing is clear – there is going to be a lot of money at stake, and the Red Sox want their share.</p>
<p>Boston has a rich history in gambling, dating back to colonial times when “betting shops” were common on Newbury Street. More recently, the city was home to “the biggest bookie in town”, Anthony Spilotro – an enforcer for the Mafia who ran gambling operations in Las Vegas and Chicago.</p>
<p>The Red Sox have been involved in gambling scandals before. In 1919, several players were accused of throwing games against the Chicago White Sox (a scandal that was later dramatized in the movie “Eight Men Out”). In 2004, former pitcher Pete Harnisch was caught placing bets on baseball games while he was a member of the Houston Astros.</p>
<p>But those days appear to be behind them. The Red Sox now seem eager to enter into the world of legal sports betting, and they’re not alone. Other teams in Boston – including the Patriots, Celtics and Bruins – are also looking to get into the game.</p>
<h1 id="Boston-Red-Sox-Calling-for-Legal-Vigorish-in-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Boston-Red-Sox-Calling-for-Legal-Vigorish-in-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Boston Red Sox Calling for Legal Vigorish in Sports Betting"></a>Boston Red Sox Calling for Legal Vigorish in Sports Betting</h1><p>The Boston Red Sox are among the many teams in sports calling for a slice of the legal sports betting pie. </p>
<p>The Sox join the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), and Major League Baseball (MLB) in their quest to get a piece of the estimated $150 billion Americans illegally wager on sports each year. Gambling is currently illegal in most states, but that may soon change.</p>
<p>“The American Gaming Association estimates that if gambling were legalized in all 50 states, it would produce between $5.7 billion and $8.5 billion in tax revenue annually,” according to The Hill.</p>
<p>Many view legalized gambling as a win-win scenario – it provides much-needed revenue for cash-strapped state and federal governments, while also allowing people to legally indulge in a pastime many enjoy. Moreover, it would create thousands of new jobs.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and other social ills, but there are ways to mitigate these risks. For example, casinos could be required to limit the amount of money people can spend on gambling, or they could be banned from operating near schools or churches.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether Congress will take up the issue of legalizing sports betting this year, but there is growing momentum for doing so. In May, Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah introduced legislation that would do just that.</p>
<p>If legalized gambling does become a reality, the Boston Red Sox stand to gain handsomely. Not only would they receive a cut of the taxes generated by casinos and other gambling establishments, but they would also be able to partner with casinos and offer their own branded sports betting products</p>
<h1 id="Boston-Red-Sox-Eager-to-Enjoy-the-Benefits-of-Legal-Vigorish-in-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Boston-Red-Sox-Eager-to-Enjoy-the-Benefits-of-Legal-Vigorish-in-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Boston Red Sox Eager to Enjoy the Benefits of Legal Vigorish in Sports Betting"></a>Boston Red Sox Eager to Enjoy the Benefits of Legal Vigorish in Sports Betting</h1><p>Boston Red Sox owner John Henry is a vocal proponent of legalized sports betting in the United States. He believes that the industry can provide a financial windfall for teams, as well as help to protect the integrity of sports.</p>
<p>“There’s no question that Boston and every other team in baseball would benefit from the legalization of sports betting,” said Henry in an exclusive interview with Larry Baer of Forbes. “It would create another revenue stream for teams, and it would make sports much more interesting for spectators.”</p>
<p>Henry is not alone in his beliefs. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has also voiced his support for legalized sports betting, as has NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. The two leagues stand to gain the most from widespread legalization, as they currently have exclusive partnerships with offshore sportsbooks.</p>
<p>But while professional leagues are eager to profit from legal gambling, they are also keen on protecting the integrity of their games. One concern is that players may be influenced to throw games if there is money on the line.</p>
<p>This fear appears to be unfounded, however. A study conducted by researchers at UNLV found that game-fixing scandals are far more common in unregulated markets such as Asia and Europe than they are in regulated markets like Nevada. In fact, no major scandal has ever occurred in a regulated U.S. market.</p>
<p>“The reality is that game-fixing scandals are much more common in unregulated markets,” said study author Dr. John Kindt. “Legalizing sports betting will actually help to protect the integrity of sports, not harm it.”</p>
<p>In addition to safeguarding against game-fixing, legalizing sports betting would also provide much-needed revenue for state governments and help to create jobs. A study by Oxford Economics estimates that legalizing sports betting could generate up to $26 billion annually in tax revenue nationwide.</p>
<p>“Legalized gaming is a huge positive for state governments,” said Kindt. “Not only does it provide much-needed revenue, but it also creates jobs in the tourism and hospitality industries.”</p>
