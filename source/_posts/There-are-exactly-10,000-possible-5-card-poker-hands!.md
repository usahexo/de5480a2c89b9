#  There are exactly 10,000 possible 5 card poker hands!

Did you know that there are exactly 10,000 possible 5 card poker hands? This may come as a surprise to some, but it’s true!

To figure this out, we first need to understand how to count the number of possible poker hands. There are 52 cards in a deck, and each card can be either a rank (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2) or a suit (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades). Therefore, the number of possible poker hands is:

\(52 \choose 5\)

Now we just need to divide by the factorial of 5 (5!) to get the answer:

\(10 \cdot 51 \cdot 50 \cdot 49 \div 5! = 10 000\)

There are 52,000 possible 5-card poker hands. That's a lot of potential combinations, and it can be tough to figure out which hand is the best.

Not all poker hands are created equal, and some are definitely better than others. In general, the higher the pair, the better the hand. So a pair of aces is better than a pair of kings, for example.

There are also other factors to consider. The rank of the cards is important, as is the suit. A flush is a hand with all of the same suit, while a straight is made up of five consecutive cards of any suit.

Here's a look at the 10 best poker hands, starting with the highest ranking:

1. Royal flush: This is the best possible hand in poker, and it's made up of an ace, king, queen, jack and ten all of the same suit.

2. Straight flush: This hand is made up of five consecutive cards all of the same suit. It's second only to a royal flush in terms of ranking.

3. Four of a kind: This hand is made up of four cards of the same rank plus one random card. It ranks just below a straight flush.

4. Full house: This hand is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. It ranks just below four of a kind and above a flush.

5. Flush: This hand is made up of five cards all of the same suit but not consecutive. It ranks below full house but above three of a kind or two pairs.

6-10: These rankings all follow on from each other in descending order - six, five, four, three and two pairs respectively

#  There are exactly 104,000 possible 5 card poker hands!

There are 104,000 possible 5 card poker hands. This can be computed by factoring in the number of ways to order the cards (52!5^5), and the number of different suits (4).

This computation assumes that there is no wild card in the deck. If there is a wild card, then the number of possible hands would be significantly higher.

#  There are exactly 208,000 possible 5 card poker hands!

This astounding number is arrived at by multiplying the number of permutations possible for 5 cards (52!) by the number of hands each player can be dealt (5). The fact that there are so many different poker hands is what makes the game so exciting and challenging.

Not all 5 card poker hands are created equal, however. Some hands are stronger than others, and being able to identify which hands are worth playing and which ones to fold is one of the key skills to becoming a successful poker player.

Here are the top five 5 card poker hands, from strongest to weakest:

1. Royal flush: This is the strongest possible hand in poker, and consists of five sequential cards of the same suit, starting with an Ace.

2. Straight flush: A straight flush is made up of five sequential cards of the same suit, but not all of them need to start with an Ace.

3. Four of a kind: As the name suggests, four of a kind consists of four cards of the same rank.

4. Full house: A full house is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank.

5. Flush: A flush is made up of five cards all of the same suit, but not all necessarily sequential.

#  You can play Sky88 and never have the same hand twice!

Now this is a pretty nifty game. If you have never played it before, it is a type of blackjack that is played with three decks of cards. And you can never have the same hand twice!

To start the game, each player is dealt two cards face down and one face up. The face up card is used to determine whether or not the player wants to hit or stay. In Sky88, hitting means taking another card and staying means keeping the current hand. The aim of the game is to get as close as possible to 21 without going over, just like classic blackjack.

The major difference between Sky88 and regular blackjack is that players are able to hit until they reach 17 in this game, whereas in classic blackjack they would only be allowed to hit once if their starting total was below 17. This makes the game much more exciting as players can try and get closer to 21 with each new card.

Another difference between the two games is that in Sky88, players can split their cards if they want to increase their chances of winning. For example, if a player has two eights then they can split them into two separate hands, whereby each hand will then receive another card.

So now you know a little bit about how Sky88 works – why not give it a go for yourself? head over to our website and start playing today!
