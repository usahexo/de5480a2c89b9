#  What is unclaimed property? 

Unclaimed property generally refers to any financial asset or piece of property that has remained unclaimed by its rightful owner for a significant period of time. This could include anything from forgotten bank accounts and stocks to uncollected life insurance payouts or forgotten rent deposits.

In most cases, the actual owner of the unclaimed property is not actually aware that it exists. As such, the responsibility of handling and managing unclaimed property usually falls on the shoulders of state governments.

The rules and regulations surrounding unclaimed property can be quite complex, but in general they are designed to protect both the owners of the property and the states themselves.

# What happens to unclaimed property? 

When it comes to unclaimed property, there are essentially two options: repatriation and escheatment. repatriation simply means returning the assets to their rightful owner, while escheatment refers to turning the assets over to the state government instead.

For example, if an individual has forgotten about a bank account worth $1,000, the bank would be responsible for repatriating that money back to the individual. However, if an individual has forgotten about a life insurance policy worth $10,000, the insurance company would be responsible for escheating that money to the state government instead.

There are a few different reasons why states might choose to escheat unclaimed property instead of repatriating it back to the rightful owner. For instance, some states may not have enough resources or staff members available to handle all the repatriation requests that come in. Alternatively, some states may believe that returning unclaimed property to its original owner is too risky or complicated due to things like changing addresses or contact information.

#  How do you find unclaimed property? 

There are a few ways to find unclaimed property. The most common way is to search online databases. You can also check with the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators (NAUPA) or your state's unclaimed property department.

#  What happens to unclaimed property? 

State laws dictate what happens to unclaimed property. Generally, the unclaimed property is turned over to the state treasurer's office. The treasurer's office attempts to find the rightful owner of the property. If the rightful owner cannot be located, the money or other assets are used to benefit state residents in some way. 

There are a few exceptions to this general rule. For instance, some states allow financial institutions to keep unclaimed property if it is worth less than a certain amount. In addition, some states require that unclaimed property be used to pay for state government expenses. 

The process of claiming unclaimed property can be difficult. The treasurer's office typically does not publicize the fact that it is holding unclaimed property. In order to claim the property, you will likely need to know where to look and what paperwork to complete. 

If you think you may be entitled to unclaimed property, it is important to consult with an attorney who specializes in this area of law. This will ensure that you do not miss any important deadlines and that you make the most of your claim.

#  Who can claim unclaimed property? 

Typically, the rightful owner of unclaimed property can go to their state's treasury department or unclaimed property office to claim their assets. There are a few exceptions, however. For example, if the rightful owner of the assets is a minor or if the rightful owner cannot be located despite a diligent search, then another party may claim the assets on behalf of the rightful owner. 

In addition, certain entities such as banks, insurance companies, and utility providers are typically allowed to claim abandoned property as "holders" before it goes to the state. This is done in order to protect their interests in case the rightful owner does eventually come forward to claim their property. 

Generally speaking, most states have procedures in place for people who believe they may be entitled to unclaimed property to file a claim. The state will then do a search to try and locate the rightful owner of the assets. If the rightful owner cannot be located after a reasonable search has been conducted, then the state will usually award the assets to the holder(s). 

If you have any questions about claiming unclaimed property or would like more information, please contact your state's treasury or unclaimed property office.
