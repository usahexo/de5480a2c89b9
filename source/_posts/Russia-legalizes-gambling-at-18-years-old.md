#  Russia legalizes gambling at 18 years old

The Russian parliament has legalized gambling for people 18 years of age and older, a move that is seen as a way to revive the country's struggling gambling industry.

This change in the law, which will come into effect in 2019, will allow casinos to be built outside of major cities and also permits Russians to gamble on the internet. The government expects this to generate an additional $2.3 billion in tax revenue each year.

Back in 2006, Russia banned gambling altogether in an effort to protect citizens from addiction. This new law is seen as a more moderate approach that will help regulate the industry while also bringing in much-needed revenue.

There are some restrictions included in the new legislation, such as a ban on foreigners owning Russian gambling businesses and a requirement that casinos be at least 100 kilometers away from schools and other places where minors are likely to gather.

Gambling has been prevalent in China for centuries. The Chinese believe that gambling can expel evil spirits and bring good luck. Officially, gambling is legal in China only for Chinese citizens at 18 years old or older, but unofficially, many forms of gambling are available to people of all ages.

Online gaming is the most popular form of gambling in China. There are hundreds of online casinos catering to Chinese players.Players can gamble on casino games such as slots, roulette, blackjack, and poker, or bet on sports matches.In addition, there are many unofficial online casinos that allow players as young as 12 years old to gamble.

Live casino gambling is also popular in China. There are now a number of casinos in Macau and other parts of Asia that cater specifically to Chinese gamblers. Players can bet on table games such as blackjack, baccarat, roulette, and poker, as well as slot machines.

The Chinese government has been trying to crack down on illegal gambling, but with mixed results. In recent years there has been a surge in online gaming revenue as more and more people move away from traditional brick-and-mortar casinos. This growth is likely to continue in the coming years as the Chinese government focuses more on the crackdown

#  Spain allows gambling at 18 years old with some restrictions

Spain gambling age is 18 years old and is a legal activity in the country. Spain has a number of different types of gambling, which are all regulated by a government authority known as DGOJ. The most popular form of gambling in Spain is betting on football matches, but there are also casinos and bingo halls. Slot machines are prohibited nationwide, which is different from other European countries such as the United Kingdom where they are popular.

The minimum legal age to gamble in Spain was lowered from 21 to 18 in 2012. This followed an amendment to the Gaming Act passed in 2011 that allowed for more liberalisation of gambling in the country. Whilst 18 year olds are able to gamble in Spain, there are restrictions on the type of gambling that they can participate in. For example, under-18s are not allowed to bet on horse racing or greyhound racing.

One of the reasons for the change in the gambling age was to bring it into line with other European countries. The Spanish government felt that by lowering the age, it would make it easier for young people to gamble in a safer and more responsible environment. It was also hoped that it would help to boost the countryâ€™s gaming industry, which was struggling at the time due to the recession.

Whilst some people have criticised the change in the age, arguing that it will lead to more problem gambling, others feel that it is a positive step that will help to protect young people from harm. In any case, there will likely be further research conducted into the effects of reducing the gambling age in order to get a better understanding of how it impacts on society as a whole
