#  National Harbor Casino Set to Open in December

The new National Harbor Casino is set to open its doors in December, just in time for the holiday season. The $1.3 billion resort will feature a casino floor with over 125,000 square feet of gaming space, complete with 1,500 slot machines and 130 table games. There will also be a luxury hotel with 684 rooms, as well as 15 restaurants and bars, a spa, and a variety of retail shops.

National Harbor is located just south of Washington D.C., making it the perfect destination for tourists and locals alike. The casino has been in the works for over five years and is expected to create over 1,500 jobs. It is also expected to generate $200 million in annual revenue for the state of Maryland.

Governor Larry Hogan was on hand for the groundbreaking ceremony in 2013, and he expressed his excitement about the project. "This is going to be an absolute top-notch facility," he said at the time. "It's going to create jobs, it's going to create economic development, and it's going to be great for tourism."

Construction on the casino began in 2014 and has been plagued by delays. But now that it is finally nearing completion, excitement is building among locals and visitors alike. "I'm so excited," said local resident Jackie Ladd. "This is going to be such a great addition to our area."

The National Harbor Casino is sure to be a hit when it opens later this year!

#  National Harbor's New Casino to Offer Double Down Free Chips

National Harbor's new casino is set to open in the fall of 2019 and it will offer Double Down free chips. The casino is being built on the banks of the Potomac River and it will feature a 120,000-square-foot gaming floor, a 300-room hotel, and a variety of restaurants. It will also have a 1,500-seat theater for concerts and other events.

The new casino is expected to create 1,200 jobs and generate $250 million in annual revenue. It will be Maryland's largest casino and it will rival the casinos in Atlantic City and Las Vegas. Construction is already underway and it is expected to be completed in the fall of 2019.

The new casino is being built by MGM Resorts International, which also owns casinos in Las Vegas, Detroit, and National Harbor. MGM Resorts International has been investing heavily in its properties over the past few years and it has been making a profit despite the downturn in the gaming industry.

The new casino at National Harbor is part of a larger trend in the gaming industry. Casinos are no longer just places to gamble; they are entertainment destinations that offer something for everyone. This has been helped by the growth of online gambling, which has made gambling more accessible to people around the world.

Casinos are also benefiting from the legalization of gambling in new markets. The global gaming market is expected to reach $533 billion by 2023, up from $451 billion in 2018. This growth is being fueled by expansion into new markets such as Japan and India.

The growth of the gaming industry has been good news for investors such as MGM Resorts International. The stock price of MGM Resorts International has doubled over the past two years, making it one of the best performing stocks on the S&P 500.

#  National Harbor's New Casino Features Double Down Free Chips

National Harbor's (NH) new casino is already a popular spot, thanks in part to the DoubleDown free chips promotion. The 300,000 square-foot casino has 2,500 slot machines and 125 table games.

Prior to opening, NH offered $100 in free DoubleDown chips to each of the first 10,000 people who registered for a player's card. That promotion generated a lot of buzz and helped build excitement for the new casino. It was so successful that NH decided to offer the same promotion again from November 28-December 2.

The new casino is also home to eight restaurants, including several that are exclusive to NH. Maryland Live! Casino, which is about 20 miles away, doesn't have any restaurants that are exclusive to its property.

One of the things that makes NH stand out is its "Poker Lounge." It's one of the few places in the region where people can play poker. There are 16 tables and plenty of space for players to spread out. In addition to poker, NH also offers blackjack, craps, roulette and three card poker.

The slots at NH are doing quite well. In fact, they're generating more than twice as much revenue as the slots at Maryland Live!. This may be due in part to the higher payout rates at NH. For example, the payout rate for penny slots at NH is 95%, while it's only 88% at Maryland Live!.

NH has been busy hiring staff and it now employs 1,200 people. Many of those employees are recent college graduates who were drawn to NH by its great benefits package, which includes health insurance and 401(k) contributions.
