The different weapon skins available in CSGO can be found at different odds, so it’s important to do your research before making any bets. You can find a list of all the weapons and their respective odds on websites such as csgoroulettetips.com .

How does CSGO Roulette work?

CSGO roulette works by spinning a virtual wheel that contains all of the different weapon skins available in CSGO. When you make a bet, you are betting on which weapon skin the next spin of the wheel will land on. If your prediction is correct, you win the bet amount multiplied by the odds of that weapon skin.

If your prediction is incorrect, you lose your bet amount. It’s important to note that there is no house edge in CSGO roulette, so players can theoretically win 100% of their bets if they correctly predict every outcome. However, due to variance , it’s not likely that anyone will actually achieve this feat.
