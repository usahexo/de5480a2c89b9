#  People with damage to the frontal lobe make bad choices when gambling, study finds

People with damage to the frontal lobe make bad choices when gambling, according to a study by researchers at the University of Alberta.

The frontal lobe is responsible for executive functions, including decision making and impulse control. The study found that people with damage to this area are more likely to make risky choices when gambling, such as betting more money than they can afford to lose.

“The frontal lobes are important for weighing the risks and benefits of our decisions, and for controlling our impulses,” said Dr. Alex Borodin, lead author of the study. “Damage to this area can lead to problems with judgement and decision making, which may explain why people with damage to the frontal lobe are more prone to risky behaviour when gambling.”

The study involved 33 participants with damage to the frontal lobe and 33 healthy control participants. Participants were asked to play a game in which they could win or lose money. The results showed that people with damage to the frontal lobe were more likely to make bad choices when gambling, such as betting more money than they could afford to lose.

This study provides important insights into how damage to the frontal lobe affects decision making and risky behaviour. It may help researchers develop better treatments for people with gambling addiction or other behavioural problems caused by damage to the frontal lobe.

#  Damage to brain region linked to poor decision-making found in problem gamblers

Problem gambling may be linked to damage in a brain region that's important for making decisions, according to a preliminary study.

The findings suggest that people with this type of damage may be more likely to develop gambling problems.

The study involved 20 problem gamblers and 20 people without a gambling problem. Each participant had an MRI scan to measure the volume of gray matter in a region of the brain called the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).

The results showed that problem gamblers had less gray matter in the mPFC than people who didn't have a gambling problem. This suggests that the damage in this brain region may be linked to poor decision-making and problem gambling.

The study was presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in San Diego.

#  Poor decision-making could be key driver of problem gambling behaviours

The aim of the study was to determine if problem gambling behaviour is associated with impaired decision-making. A total of 116 participants with problem gambling behaviours and 116 matched healthy controls took part in the study. They were all required to complete a series of decision-making tasks, including the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), which assesses four dimensions of decision making: risk aversion, reward sensitivity, perseveration and cognitive flexibility.

The findings of the study showed that participants with problem gambling behaviours exhibited significantly poorer decision-making abilities on the IGT compared to healthy controls. They were more likely to choose cards that resulted in losses over cards that resulted in wins, indicating poorer risk assessment abilities. They were also more likely to perseverate (keep choosing options that led to losses) and less able to switch strategies when this was needed. These findings suggest that poor decision-making could be a key driver of problem gambling behaviours.

The study’s lead author, Dr Monnie Chan from Macquarie University, said: “Our findings provide evidence for the role of impaired decision-making in problem gambling behaviour. This is an important step forward in understanding what drives these risky behaviours.” The findings of the study could help to inform interventions for people with problem gambling behaviours, such as targeted cognitive behavioural therapy.

#  Study links poor judgement in blackjack to damage in specific brain area

Blackjack is a popular casino game that typically involves betting against the house. A recent study has found that poor judgement in blackjack may be related to damage in a specific brain area.

The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, looked at the link between judgement and decision-making abilities in blackjack and damage in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ACC is a part of the brain that is responsible for regulating emotions and cognitive function.

The study found that participants with damage in the ACC showed poorer judgement and decision-making skills when playing blackjack. These participants were also more likely to make risky bets and take longer to make decisions.

The findings of this study suggest that damage to the ACC may lead to poorer judgement and decision-making skills in various contexts, not just blackjack. This could have important implications for people with brain damage caused by injuries or diseases.

#  Damage to certain part of brain may explain why some people make risky gambling decisions

_In a study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, researchers found that people who make risky gambling decisions tend to have less activity in a certain area of the brain._

The study participants were asked to choose between a guaranteed $5 payout or an option where they could win either $6 or nothing. The researchers found that those with less activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were more likely to choose the riskier option.

This part of the brain is involved in decision making and controlling impulses. Previous studies have shown that damage to this area can lead to problems with impulse control and judgment.

_The findings from this study suggest that there may be a neural basis for why some people are more drawn to risky gambling decisions._
