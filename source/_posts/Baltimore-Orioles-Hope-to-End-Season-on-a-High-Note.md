#  Baltimore Orioles Hope to End Season on a High Note

Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter is hoping to end the 2017 season on a high note with his team. The Orioles are in fourth place in the American League East Division, and they have not been able to make it to the playoffs this year. However, the team has shown some promising signs over the past few weeks.

The Orioles have won six of their last ten games, including a victory over the Boston Red Sox in their most recent game. This was a significant win, as the Red Sox are one of the top teams in the league.

In that game, Baltimore Orioles shortstop Tim Beckham hit an RBI single in the bottom of the ninth inning to give his team the win. This was an exciting moment for Beckham and for the Orioles fans who were watching.

The Orioles will be playing their final game of the season on October 1st. They will be facing off against the Toronto Blue Jays, and they will be looking to get another win under their belt.

#  Baltimore Orioles Hope New Additions Bolster the Line-Up for 2018

The Baltimore Orioles hope the new additions to their line-up in 2018 can bolster their chance at making it back to the playoffs after a disappointing 2017 season.

In December, they acquired shortstop Manny Machado from the Dodgers and first baseman Chris Davis from the division-rival Yankees.

Davis had slumped in recent years and was coming off an offseason during which he was paid $161 million over seven years by New York. However, the Orioles believe his left-handed power bat could provide a needed boost to their offense.

"He's had a few down years," Orioles executive vice president Dan Duquette said of Davis. "But we think Chris is primed for a big year."

Machado, who is entering his final season before free agency, is coming off a 2017 season in which he hit .273 with 33 homers and 95 RBIs. He has played six seasons in the major leagues, all with Baltimore.

The Orioles also signed right-handed pitchers Alex Cobb and Andrew Cashner during the offseason.

Cobb spent his first six seasons with Tampa Bay before signing a four-year, $57 million contract with theBaltimore Orioles in March. The 30-year-old went 12-10 with a 3.66 ERA last season for the Rays.

Cashner, 31, began his career with San Diego before signing a two-year, $16 million contract with Texas in February 2017. He was 10-11 with a 3.40 ERA last year for the Rangers.

#  Baltimore Orioles: The Underdog Team of the MLB

The Baltimore Orioles are the underdogs of the MLB. Despite being one of the older teams in the league, they havenâ€™t had a lot of success in terms of winning championships. However, this season they are proving all the skeptics wrong and have been one of the most exciting teams to watch.

One of the main reasons for their success is their star outfielder, Adam Jones. He has been a consistent performer for the Orioles, both offensively and defensively. Another player who has been contributing to their wins is Manny Machado. He is a young third baseman who has a lot of potential and is already putting up some impressive stats.

The Orioles bullpen has also been doing a great job this season. Zach Britton is their top reliever and he has been getting quite a few strikeouts this year. Overall, the Orioles are a team that should not be underestimated. They have proved that they can compete with the best teams in the league and they will definitely be a force to reckon with in the playoffs.

#  Making History: Baltimore Orioles clinch playoff berth for first time since 1997 

After a nail-biting victory against the Toronto Blue Jays on Sept. 26, the Baltimore Orioles have officially clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 1997. This momentous occasion was captured on camera by Orioles broadcaster Gary Thorne, who could not contain his excitement and let out a loud cheer.

The Orioles' long-awaited return to the playoffs is especially poignant given the team's history of heartbreak. In 2002, they made it all the way to the American League Championship Series, only to lose in heartbreaking fashion to the Los Angeles Angels. In fact, Baltimore has not won a pennant in any major league sport since 1983.

So what can fans expect from this year's Orioles squad? First and foremost, they are an extremely versatile team that can beat you in a variety of ways. Their lineup features several potent sluggers, such as Adam Jones and Chris Davis, who have both already surpassed 30 home runs this season. They also have an excellent starting rotation, led by veteran pitcher Chris Tillman.

In order to advance in the playoffs, the Orioles will likely have to go through the Detroit Tigers or Boston Red Sox - two of the strongest teams in the American League. But with their talented roster and never-say-die attitude, there's no telling what this scrappy underdog team can accomplish.

#  Buck Showalter Could be Heading Out as Baltimore Orioles Manager

There is a lot of speculation that Buck Showalter could be on his way out as the Baltimore Orioles manager. The team has not been doing well this season and there have been reports of tension between Showalter and some of the players.

Showalter has been the Orioles manager since 2010. In that time, he has led the team to three playoff appearances, including a trip to the American League Championship Series in 2014. However, the Orioles have not had a winning season since 2016 and they are currently in last place in the American League East.

There have been questions about whether or not Showalter is the right man to lead the Orioles rebuild. Some people believe that a change in leadership could help get the team back on track.

The Orioles are reportedly considering firing Showalter and replacing him with former Yankees manager Joe Girardi. Girardi is a nine-time All-Star who led the Yankees to a World Series championship in 2009. He was fired by New York at the end of last season after eight years at the helm.

If Showalter is fired, it will be interesting to see what he does next. He has already said that he does not plan on retiring and he could likely find another managing job fairly easily.
