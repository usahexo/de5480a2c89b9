#  LA Clippers Play Craps With 32 Chinese Dominoes

It had been an interesting day for the LA Clippers. Hours earlier, they’d walked into the Staples Center to discover a red cloth draped over their bench and a set of regulation-sized dice sitting in front of it. Coach Doc Rivers looked at his team and assessed the challenge.

“We’re going to play craps with32 Chinese dominoes today, gang,” he announced. “If you lose, you have to run laps around the court. But if you win, we get a free dinner from Danny’s Pizza.”

The players were excited by the prospect of some craps action and quickly got down to business. The game started off well for the Clippers, with Tobias Harris rolling snakeeyes on his very first roll. But things went downhill from there as the team proceeded to lose six straight hands. As punishment, DeAndre Jordan was forced to do 30 pushups while Lou Williams had to run 10 laps around the court.

With their stomachs growling in anticipation, the Clippers gathered around the table for one final hand. This time, luck was on their side as Harris rolled another pair of snakeeyes to give them the victory. They all cheered as they headed over to Danny’s Pizza to claim their free dinner.

#  Craps: The Game Played With A Set Of A Set Involving 32 Chinese Dominoes

 Craps is a dice game where players bet on the outcome of a roll of two dice. The game has many variants, but the most popular one is played with a set of 32 Chinese dominoes.

The aim of the game is to score points by matching the symbols on the dominoes. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

To begin, each player chooses seven dominoes and sets them in front of them. The remaining dominoes are placed in the middle of the players, face down. One player starts by flipping over the first domino in the middle. If this domino matches one of their own, they can claim it and set it in front of them. If not, they must place it back in the middle and turn over another domino.

If a player flips over a domino that matches one of their opponents, they must hand it over to them and play passes to the next player clockwise. When all 7 dominoes have been claimed, players take another turn picking up from where they left off.

The player who collects all 7 dominoes first wins the round and scores 1 point for each different symbol on their dominos. Play then starts afresh with players picking up 7 more dominos from the middle. The first player to score 11 points (or more) wins the game.

#  32 Chinese Dominoes Used In Game Of Craps

Introduced in the 1920s, craps is a casino dice game where players place bets on the outcome of rolling two dice. The game has many variants but the most popular form is the "don't pass" bet which gives players the option to bet against the shooter. In this article, we will explore how to play craps and cover some of the basic rules and terminology.

To begin, each player must make a bet on either the Pass or Don't Pass line. The shooter then rolls two dice and if their total is 7 or 11, they "pass" and their round ends. If they roll a 2, 3 or 12, their round ends immediately and they lose. If any other number is rolled (4,5,6,8,9,10), that number becomes the point and the shooter continues rolling until either they hit the point again (which results in a win for Pass Line bets) or they roll a 7 (which results in a loss for Pass Line bets).

As mentioned earlier, the most popular variant of craps is the don't pass bet which gives players the option to bet against the shooter. For example, if you were to place a don't pass bet on  $5 and the shooter rolls a 7, you would win $5 since your bet would have been correct. Conversely, if you placed a don't pass bet and the shooter rolled a 2 or 3, you would lose $5 since those are both losing numbers.

There are also various side bets that can be made in craps such as betting on individual numbers or whether or not a particular number will be rolled before a 7 is rolled. However, these bets tend to be much lower odds than placing a wager on either Pass or Don't Pass so it's generally recommended to stick with those two options unless you're familiar with all of the different side bets available.

Now that we've covered the basics of how to play craps, let's take a look at some of the more common terminology that you'll encounter during a game:

Pass Line: A bet that pays out when the shooter rolls a 7 or 11.

Don't Pass: A bet that pays out when the shooter rolls 2, 3 or 12. Loses when shooters roll any other number.

Point: The number (4,5,6,8,9 or 10) that must be rolled again before a 7 to win for Pass Line Bets.


7: The number that loses for Pass Line Bets when it's rolled before Point
